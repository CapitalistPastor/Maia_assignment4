
//Create a class called DuplicateRemover. .......................................[done]

// Create an instance method called remove ......................................[done]
//  that takes a single parameter called dataFile of type String ................[done]
// 	(representing the path to a text file) ......................................
// 	and 
// 	uses a Set of Strings to eliminate duplicate words from the file referenced..
// 	by dataFile. ................................................................[
// 	The unique words should be stored in an instance variable called uniqueWords.[

// Create an instance method called write .......................................
// 	that takes a single parameter called outputFile .............................
// 	(representing the path to a text file) 
// 	and 
// 	writes the words contained in uniqueWords to the file pointed to by outputFile. 

// The output file should be overwritten...........................................
//  if it already exists ..........................................................
//  and created if it does not exist...............................................

//Create a separate class called Application ......................................[done]
// that contains a main method which illustrates the use of DuplicateRemover
// by calling both the remove and write methods.
// Your input file must be called problem1.txt.....................................[done]
// and
// your output file must be called unique_words.txt. 
// Your input file should be located within your project structure 
// so that you can reference it with the relative path of "problem1.txt"
// and not an absolute path such as "c:\users\chris\pa4p1\problem1.txt". 

// You will not receive credit if you use different file names....................
// as my graders will not modify your code to make it work with their test files..
